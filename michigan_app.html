    <h2>A brief overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Michigan App is the official app of the University of Michigan. Built with the purpose of acquainting students, staff and visitors to campus resources in one place, the Michigan App is often where people get the first impression of the University
        of Michigan in a digital space. Live since 2016, the Michigan App has over 50,000 downloads on the Google Play Store and serves an average of around 14,000 users per month. And that's just Android– the majority of the users of the Michigan App
        actually use iOS.  However, there are many aspects of the Michigan App that have room for improvement. This has led to the app struggling to retain its users–many of them leave after using the app for a short period of time for other apps (many
        of them are developed by students). We were given the task of redesigning the app. </p>
    <h2>The process</h2>
    <h3>Phase 1: User Research</h3>
    <p>The <strong>first thing</strong> we did was do a lot of research through various UX methods:</p>

    <p><strong>Object Oriented User Experience (OOUX):</strong> showed us what components had overlap / what we could merge together</p>
    <p><strong>Heuristic evaluation:</strong> identified all issues with the app (with varying severities)</p>
    <p><strong>Surveys:</strong> helped us understand user needs and gave us ideas for new features</p>
    <p><strong>Information Architecture (IA) Diagram:</strong> laid out everything we had to work with</p>
    <p><strong>Contextual inquiry of developers:</strong> helped us understand how feasible our ideas were</p>
    <p><strong>Competitive analysis:</strong> helped us understand what works and what doesn't. Gave us some inspiration for our own features</p>
    <p><strong>Impact-effort graph:</strong> allowed us to come up with a list of quick fixes</p>

    <h3>Phase 2: Identifying Problems and Solutions</h3>
    <p>
        After wrapping up our research, we identified the main problems: </p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. Struggling to successfully meet everyone's needs</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The Michigan App has 3 primary personas: students, faculty and staff. Each of these user groups have different needs, and the old Michigan App was trying to appease everyone (but in reality, not satisfying anyone). To solve this, we introduce modularity.
        Each section will be separated into individual modules that can be collapsed, hidden, and rearranged. The homepage will consist of these modules, and users can determine which ones they want to include and which ones they want to leave out. Thus,
        users can customize their homepage to meet their needs (e.g students might include the module related to dining halls and leave out parking, while staff may do the opposite).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            2. Difficult to navigate and find features, especially the navigation/transportation features
        </strong>
    </p>

    <p>Navigation and directions is an essential part of a lot of the features on the app. It is also something that is used by all users. However, they are often spread out and difficult to navigate.  To solve this, we introduce 'Places', a singular page
        where features that require navigation (bus, dining, parking, and class location) are displayed. </p>
