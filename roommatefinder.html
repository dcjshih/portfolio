    <h2>A brief overview</h2>
    <p>In the last decade, there has been a dramatic decline in mental well-being in colleges: The long-running University of Michigan Healthy Minds study shows that <strong>41% of students are experiencing depression</strong>, and <strong>
        36% percent have been
            diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.
    </strong> Universities are trying to solve this by increasing access to treatment. However, treatment is still stigmatized, expensive, and has long waitlists. Despite efforts to address this issue through increased access to treatment, existing solutions
        face challenges such as stigma, high costs, and lengthy waitlists. Moreover, these interventions primarily focus on students already experiencing mental health issues, neglecting prevention for new students. <strong>
            RoommateFinder develops software to
            prevent mental health problems from arising in the first place.
        </strong> How? One of the biggest findings in social science is that the key to happiness and good mental health isn’t money, fame, internships, or the Dean’s list, but social connections. Some have even argued that the lack of it is as bad for
        us as smoking. As humans, we know this - and also as humans, we don’t always do what we know is best for us. There’s a gap between our intentions and our actions. That’s where universities need to come in: they should nudge their students to make
        meaningful social connections.
    </p>
    <h2>The process</h2>
    <h3>Phase 1: Customer Discovery</h3>
    <p>We conducted extensive customer discovery over a couple of weeks. We conducted 38 in-depth interviews and had informal conversations with many others. This was the breakdown for the 38 people we interviewed: 3 influencers (RAs and hall directors),
        24 buyers (university residence life directors, assignment coordinators/directors, summer camp directors), and 11 users (students and students we swapped). We were able to speak to most of the people in our influencer and user stakeholders through
        personal connections and referrals, but unfortunately, we had to cold call a lot of our buyers, which was pretty difficult. However, being persistent paid off, and we managed to not only get a lot of key insights about our customers but also stir
        up some interest in our product. Because we were able to talk to people in so many different positions, it gave us excellent insight into what exactly we could do to make our product better and even more competitive. </p>
    <h4>Here are our takeaways:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>92% of the universities we talked to experienced roommate issues</strong></li>
        <li><strong>
                Some of the universities we spoke to used pairing software already, but the student adoption rate was generally 50-60%.</strong>
            <p>This was because the user experience for the existing software wasn’t great, and many of the students gave up halfway through the process because it just wasn’t worth it. This helped us realize what a big impact user experience would have–even
                if the algorithm works wonders, customers won’t be willing to use it if the interface is bad.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>6 universities pair by hand.</strong>
            <p>Many of them simply don’t have the budget to buy pairing software.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Existing pairing software costs anywhere from 2.5 to 5 USD per person</strong>
            <p>This helped us understand what the current willingness to pay was for roommate pairing software. </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Phase 2: Product Design and Development</h3>
    <p>
        Over this semester, RoommateFinder tested out 3 different solutions to the roommate-related problem we identified: <strong>pairing</strong>, <strong>check-in</strong>, and <strong>swapping</strong>. We hypothesized these solutions could work together
        (or individually) to reduce roommate conflict and boost well-being on campus.
    </p>
    <h4>Pairing</h4>
    <p>The pairing solutionis RoommateFinder&rsquo;s primary offering. As stated on our website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we work with a university to pair their roommates for them, using our research-backed questionnaire and data-driven pairing algorithm. By pairing compatible roommates, we hope to prevent roommate conflict that usually arises when pairings are random (or otherwise low quality). The reduction in roommate conflict links back to our aforementioned value proposition. The algorithm is backed by <strong>415 freshmen responses</strong>, and ca. 50 questions long (from personality studies, roommate compatibility meta-reviews, through help from universities).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Over the summer and throughout the semester, we ran multiple key experiments to test this solution. For example, we tested the functionality of our website, pilot, and algorithm with a <strong>UofM Theme Community,</strong> for about 50 students.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We found key bugs and fixed them for students, but in the end were able to validate that both our algorithm and matching process function as it was designed to do. We are currently waiting for roommate satisfaction results to become statistically significant. Additionally, we wanted to validate that universities agree with our design choices, and if that would be something they want to endorse to students.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Therefore, we showed screenshots of our current product to them and asked for feedback/advice. Apart from small changes (e.g. verification methods of students), the universities and summer camps we spoke to appreciated the designs we presented. They
        specifically pointed out the simple, clear, and good-looking user interface. This was not a surprise to us - the market leader for housing software used to make software for prisons, and their UI/UX looks like it.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Finally, we wanted to determine if we could potentially position ourselves to be an &ldquo;on top&rdquo; solution of an already existing but bad solution. That way, universities could slowly but safely adopt our solution, making change management
        easier.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Through customer discovery, we found out that some universities are interested, while others aren&rsquo;t. Institutions using &lsquo;StarRez&rsquo; seemed open to this type of engagement.&nbsp;<strong>Eastern Michigan University (EMU)&nbsp;is one of these universities. </strong></p>
    <h4>Check-in</h4>
    <p>
        Our second solution, Check-in, aims to “check in” with roommates about their current satisfaction and the challenges they are facing. From there, check-in would a) help RAs “triage” roommate conflicts, and b) offer personalized advice on conflict mitigation.
        Specifically, this advice is intended to get roommates talking about their conflicts and mitigate them collaboratively. While this wouldn’t prevent roommate conflicts, it would help treat them more effectively, cheaply, and quickly- again, in
        line with our aforementioned value proposition. We ran several key experiments to validate this proposition:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Are universities interested in this?</strong>
            <p>We ran customer discovery, and both Miami University and Illinois Institute of Technology said they would be interested in testing this solution</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Given that at least some universities are interested in this, is there research out there supporting our design hypothesis to get roommates talking to each other about conflict? </strong>
            <p>We found out that there was. Specifically, the concept of “Implementation Intentions” coupled with basic ideas from conflict resolution drove our UI/UX design. We then met with our advisor, Ryan Goble, who has an extensive background in teaching
                and behavioral psychology, to get further feedback on our research reviews and design implementations. The result was the following design:</p>
